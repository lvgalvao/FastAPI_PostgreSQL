With FastAPI, you can build APIs in Python that are fast, secure, and automated. FastAPI is based on Pydantic, a Python library for data validation and settings, and uses type hints to validate and serialize data. It also automatically generates OpenAPI documents for your APIs, allowing you to easily document and test them. It also supports asynchronous programming, and can be run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.
